# CodeAlpha_Emotion_Recognition_from_Speech_Task2
Human communication is deeply emotional. Emotion Recognition from Speech (ERS) aims to identify the underlying emotional state of a speaker using audio cues. This is particularly important in the era of human-computer interaction, where intelligent systems are expected to understand not just words, but also the speakerâ€™s tone and emotion.
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately recognize human emotions from raw audio speech signals. This recognition is based purely on vocal characteristics, without relying on visual data such as facial expressions. The system is intended to classify audio samples into discrete emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition
Human communication is deeply emotional. Emotion Recognition from Speech (ERS) aims to identify the underlying emotional state of a speaker using audio cues. This is particularly important in the era of human-computer interaction, where intelligent systems are expected to understand not just words, but also the speakerâ€™s tone and emotion.
The goal is to build a machine learning pipeline that can:
â€¢	Process raw speech signals,
â€¢	Extract meaningful acoustic features,
â€¢	Train a model that learns emotional patterns,
â€¢	Accurately classify new/unseen speech samples.

ðŸ§  Importance and Applications
â€¢	Virtual Assistants (like Alexa, Google Assistant): To better respond to the userâ€™s emotional context.
â€¢	Mental Health Monitoring: Early detection of stress, depression, or anxiety based on voice patterns.
â€¢	Call Centers: Automatically detect frustration or dissatisfaction in customer calls.
â€¢	Education: Adaptive learning systems based on students' emotional state.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
Dataset Name: RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
â€¢	Source: Zenodo Repository
â€¢	Language: English
â€¢	Format: WAV files
â€¢	Actors: 24 (12 male, 12 female)
â€¢	Emotions Covered:
o	Neutral
o	Calm
o	Happy
o	Sad
o	Angry
o	Fearful
o	Disgust
o	Surprised
Each audio file is labeled with its emotion and actor identity encoded in its filename. The speech is expressed with two different emotional intensities (normal and strong), adding variability to the dataset.
